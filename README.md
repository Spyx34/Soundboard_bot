# Soundboard_bot
Just a discord Bot written in python

I know, there may be much easier ways to write this code, pls dont judge me

# Customization
If you want to add sounds, all you gotta do is, add the sound(file name must be the emoji on which it should be played)
and add "await sound_board.add_reaction("EMOJI_THE_MP3_IS_NAMED_AFTER")" at line 27
